<h1>The best series according to Moeen Muhammad</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Animes of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Berserk</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime because the artist makes me feel immersed in the anime and the main character shows immense character development throughout the series.</p>

<h3>One punch Man</h3>
<p>This is my second favourite anime only because of saitamaðŸ˜ƒ</p>

<h3>Death note</h3>
<p>No reason to not like it.</p>
